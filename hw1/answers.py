**Your answer:**

the linear model "learn" dominant features in each number that are common among most
of the given training set, for example it's easy to see in the weights representing the digit 0, 
that the model learned a round shape, similar to zero.
the classification error are from digits that have features similar to other digits, for example the digit 4
can be mistaken be the number 9 in some cases.


"""

part3_q3 = r"""
**Your answer:**

1.from looking at the training loss and accuracy we can tell that the learning rate is good. at the beginning there
are some big jumps at the accuracy and small jumps at the loss but the overall behavior of the two graphs good.
 if we would decrease the training rate the training loss would be much higher than it is for this learning rate, 
 which means that it will take more training time to reach the same results. for higher learning rate the learning 
 could become "unstable" and could not converge.  

2.
from looking at the training and test results we can say that the training Slightly overfitted to the training set.
the training and validation results at the end of the training is around 85%-90% and the test set is around 80%, this 
is actually not so bad results because we will always have some over-fitting.

part4_q1 = r"""
**Your answer:**

the perfect behavior we expect in the residual plot is a perfect monoticly decreasing or increasing points.
that kind of behavior means that for every given data (x axis) we can get one price estimation. (Injective function
)
